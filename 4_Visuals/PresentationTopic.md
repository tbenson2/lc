# Presentation Topic
I'd like to do my presentation on SuperCollider. It's a fascinating language I'd like to learn more about, plus it might be something I want to use for my capstone project (I outlined the reasons why in my email to you the other day).

Edit:

Specifically I'd like to look at SuperCollider and how you can handle live audio input. That's exactly what I want to research for my capstone.
