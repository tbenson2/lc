## Taylor Benson

## 2 things I didn't know:
- I never realized the apparent oxymoronic combination of "laptop" and "orchestra" before.
- Until now I've only thought of live coding as a solo activity. The idea of networks being involved in the performance never crossed my mind.

## 2 things I already knew:
- I'm familiar with some of the software PLOrk uses. I've worked with Max/MSP, and a bit of ChucK.
- I already knew that the large modern orchestra as we know it today came after the much smaller chamber and baroque orchestras.
