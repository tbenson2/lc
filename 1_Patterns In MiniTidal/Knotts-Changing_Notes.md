# Knotts: Changing
## Taylor Benson

## 2 things I already knew:
- I briefly remember the #Occupy movement, and it's interesting to read how it connects to what we're doing in class.
- I am a big proponent of improvisation, and I've always been less interested in accurately representing someone else's work (classical notation). Although I never thought of this view as political, I can see how it can connect to anti-heirarchical organizations.

## 2 things I didn't know:
- I never would have guessed that network music has a political edge to it.
- I never considered the difference between formal and effective democracy. I think that's important to distinguish when developing any system: What's the difference between how the system should work on paper versus how it's actually being received in reality?

First Impressions: I have no idea what she's getting at in the second paragraph. What is the significance of distinguishing the difference between democratic, equalitarian solutions versus ideal utopian solutions? It seems like one is worse than the other somehow? And how does this connect to music making?
