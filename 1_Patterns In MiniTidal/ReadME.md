# First MiniTidal Patch Documentation
## Taylor Benson

I wanted to create an interesting beat using only the concepts/samples we covered in class. One of the main ways I made my beat more interesting is by using the '?' operator. I used it on the main backbeat, so it varies randomly as the beat goes along. I also used it in the hi-hat section within the <> characters. This way the open hi-hat pattern plays only occasionally. I know that you mentioned using these <> characters means that the program picks randomly from the list, but every time I used it, the program seemed to step through the list in order and then wrap back around to the first item. Not sure if that just happened to work that way for me by chance, but I thought I'd mention it.

One thing I wanted to do but couldn't figure out how is to change the gain of individual samples/steps. I tried putting the '# gain' directly after a note, but I got a syntax error. Not sure if this is possible in MiniTidal, but I'd love to know how to do that if it is.
