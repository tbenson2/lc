I wanted to make something that sounded whole, yet empty at the same time. If you took any element away from this piece, it would feel like something is missing. I played around with the different samples and tried to see which ones went well together. I love how I could use the "d1, d2, etc." for the different orbits, instead of having to use "stack" all the time. I know that this code is not the most complex, but I think it's pretty musical.

I started with the birds. I wanted to give a nice relaxing atmosphere to the start of the show. The birds are slowed down and reversed, giving a "synth-y" quality to the sound. I made sure to add some reverb as well to really play with the space. Next was the "sine" sound. This ended up being a subdued kick-like instrument, and I like how it turned out. It varies just enough to be like "oo what is that?" without being too out there. And I think it balances well with the birds. This entire piece relies on the fact that the random silences "?" are consistent across orbits. It made me think of two tabla drummers being perfectly in sync (a-la Shakti). Because of this, I added a tabla sound to play at the same time as the sine. I pitched it up because I didn't want it to get in the way of the mid frequencies. Plus it adds a dose of "huh, what is that?" to the piece. After these elements are added, I wanted to ground it with a kick and a snare. I chose a powerful kick and slowed the speed down to subdue it a little, having it play 4 on the floor. Later on, I'm going to have the kick play in time with everything else, giving the piece a sense of finality. Finally, we have the snare sound. Honestly, I got lucky with finding the sample. I was looking for some more ambience to add to the birds, and thought "outdoors" would be great! Turns out the sounds are very high-gain and impactful, and the first sample is a very Aphex Twin-like snare that I really enjoyed. Add all of these together and you get some weird stuff! Weird yet satisfying, I hope.
